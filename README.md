Maven Roasters: Brewing Up Success with Data

Analyzed the sales data of Maven Roasters, a beloved NYC coffee shop with three locations, to help them become even more successful. Using Excel, we dug deep into their numbers, from data prep to creating insightful dashboards.

Our Goals:

•	Understanding the Grind: We wanted to see how sales fluctuated over time to understand Maven Roasters' business rhythm.

•	Peak Hours & Hustle: Identifying their busiest days and what drives those sales surges was key.

•	Bean Counting for Big Wins: We analyzed their top sellers and revenue generators to see what keeps customers coming back for more.

The Coffee Shop Scoop:

•	Morning Jolt: Seems like Maven Roasters fuels the city's early risers! Sales peak between 7 am and 10 am, highlighting a significant morning rush. Let's make sure they have everything stocked and friendly baristas ready to greet these early birds.

•	Weekday Coffee Rituals: Surprise! Mondays and Fridays are their busiest days. This suggests a customer preference for starting and ending their week with a Maven Roasters coffee. Special promotions on these days could be a golden opportunity.

•	Beyond the Cup: Coffee and tea are clearly crowd-pleasers, but packaged chocolate sales are lagging. This might be a chance to explore new varieties or promotions to unlock its full sales potential.
